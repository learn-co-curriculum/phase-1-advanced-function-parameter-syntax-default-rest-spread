# Function Parameter Syntax: Default / Rest / Spread

## Learning Goals

- Set a default value for a function parameter
- Use JavaScript's `rest` parameter to define parameters in a function
- Use JavaScript's `spread` operator in a function call

## Introduction

The typical way to handle function parameters for JavaScript functions is to
define them individually and then pass a value for each as an argument when
calling the function:

```js
function customGreeting(greeting, name, adjective, occasion) {
  return `${greeting}, ${name}! Have a ${adjective} ${occasion}!`;
}

customGreeting("Good morning", "Pouja", "fantastic", "Tuesday");
// => "Good morning, Pouja! Have a fantastic Tuesday!"
```

This always works, and is perfectly adequate a lot of the time. However, for
those times when our needs may be more complex, JavaScript provides several
helpful tools that can make handling of parameters and arguments more flexible
and efficient: default values, the `rest` parameter and the `spread` operator.
We will learn how to use all three in this lesson.

## Set a Default Value for a Function Parameter

Let's say you work for an e-commerce site, and you're prepping for your
post-holiday sales. You're working on some code for your website and you need to
set a discount of 25% across the board for everything that you sell on the
website.

We can create a function that takes in an `itemPrice` as a price in dollars and
returns the discounted price:

```js
function discountedPrice(itemPrice) {
  return itemPrice - itemPrice * 0.25;
}
```

But it seems unwise to hard-code the discount to `0.25`. Management's whims on
discount rates change almost daily, as the corporate sales office's
machine-learning algorithms recommend new discount rates. Because of this, we
want to encode the discount rate as a _parameter_ of the function.

```js
function discountedPrice(itemPrice, discount) {
  return itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
}
```

So, calls to `discountedPrice()` will look like:

```js
function discountedPrice(itemPrice, discount) {
  return itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
}
discountedPrice(100, 0.25); //=> 75.0
```

But it _also_ seems a bit of a burden to **have** to pass the discount amount on
every call. We'd like `discount` to _default_ to `0.25`. It'll be 25% off
_unless_ we choose to pass a new discount percentage into `discountedPrice()`.
We set the default value by simply assigning the value in the parameter list:

```js
function discountedPrice(itemPrice, discount = 0.25) {
  return itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
}
discountedPrice(100); //=> 75.0
```

Then if we want to use a different discount, we simply pass the new value as the
second argument â€” that value will _override_ the default value:

```js
discountedPrice(100, 0.5); //=> 50.0
```

Note that we place the parameter with a default value at the **end** of the
parameter list. This is because the argument values are assigned to the
parameters from left to right, regardless of whether a default value is
specified for any of them. If we put the discount with its default value first
and `itemPrice` second, when we call `discountedPrice(100)`, 100 will get
assigned as the discount and the `itemPrice` will be undefined. The function
would then return `NaN`:

```js
function discountedPrice(discount = 0.25, itemPrice) {
  return itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
}

discountedPrice(100);
// => NaN
```

Now say we want to add a `tax` parameter to `discountedPrice()` so that we can
include a tax percentage to be added to the discounted sales price. First we put
our function declaration back the way it was, with `discount = .25` last. Then
we add `tax` as the second parameter:

```js
function discountedAndTaxedPrice(itemPrice, tax, discount = 0.25) {
  let subtotal = itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
  return subtotal + subtotal * tax;
}

discountedAndTaxedPrice(100, 0.1); //=> 82.5
discountedAndTaxedPrice(100, 0.1, 0.2); //=> 88
```

<details><summary><b>How would you give <code>tax</code> a default of 0.1?</b></summary><p>
<code> function discountedAndTaxedPrice(itemPrice, tax = 0.10, discount = 0.25) { ... } </code>
</p></details>

You can give as many parameters a default value as you want. Again, just be sure
to put them all towards the _end_ of the parameter list. Another thing to keep
in mind when having multiple defaults, the same rule applies: <b>argument values
are assigned to the parameters from left to right</b>

So, if you need to give <code>discount</code> a non-default value, but
<code>tax</code> should still use the default, you will have to provide values
for both when invoking the function:

```js
function discountedAndTaxedPrice(itemPrice, tax = 0.1, discount = 0.25) {
  let subtotal = itemPrice - itemPrice * discount;
  return subtotal + subtotal * tax;
}

// Without providing tax - 0.3 becomes the tax
discountedAndTaxedPrice(100, 0.3); // => 97.5

// With providing tax
discountedAndTaxedPrice(100, 0.1, 0.3); // => 77
```

When using defaults, it may be helpful to consider which parameters will be
changed more often than others, then order them accordingly.

## Use JavaScript's `spread` Operator in a Function Call

In previous lessons, we've used JavaScript's `spread` operator (`...`) to copy
an array; it "spreads out" the elements of the original array into a new array.
We can use `spread` in the exact same way to pass elements of an array into a
function as an argument! Try it out in console with a simple add function:

```js
function add(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}
const arr = [1, 2, 3];

add(...arr); // => 6
```

Just as it does when we use `spread` to copy an array, the JavaScript engine
sees the `spread` operator `...` and knows to "spread out" the elements in the
array into the parentheses. In other words, it converts this: `add(...arr)` into
this: `add(1, 2, 3)`.

<details><summary><b>What do you think will happen if the array has more numbers than our function has parameters?</b></summary><p>
Nothing different! The function will still return 6. If our <code>arr</code> had more than 3 elements:

<code>
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]<br>
add(...arr) // => 6
</code>

It would be as if we were calling <code>add(1, 2, 3, 4)</code>. Having the extra
argument does not affect our code, it just does not get used.

What if we _want_ to access those extra arguments, though? We _could_ just add
more parameters, but we won't always know how many extra arguments will be
passed. If only there was a way to capture them some other way... oh wait, there
is!

</p></details>

## Use JavaScript's `rest` Parameter to Define Parameters in a Function

We've learned how to use the `spread` operator to _pass arguments_ to functions,
but we can also use the `...` syntax in our function's _parameter list_. In this
context, it's called the `rest` parameter because it allows us to capture the
`rest` of the arguments that are passed into the function and store them in an
array.

Sometimes, we might not know exactly how many arguments we want to pass into a
function, but we might know that we only want to do something with the first two
arguments. In JavaScript, it's possible to pass in any number of arguments into
a function when we call it, regardless of how many parameters are defined:

```js
function muppetLab(a, b) {
  console.log(a, b); // LOG: Dr. Bunson Beaker
}

muppetLab("Dr. Bunson", "Beaker", "Miss Piggy", "Kermit", "Animal");
```

Here we have two parameters defined, so the first two arguments are stored into
those variables. But what happens if we want to capture the leftover arguments?
The `rest` parameter allows us to take the rest of the arguments that we pass in
to the function, regardless of how many there are, and gather them into an
array. Here's how this works:

```js
function muppetLab(a, b, ...muppets) {
  console.log(a, b); // Dr. Bunson Beaker

  console.log(muppets); // ["Miss Piggy", "Kermit", "Animal"]
  console.log(muppets[0]); // Miss Piggy
  console.log(muppets.length); // 3
}

muppetLab("Dr. Bunson", "Beaker", "Miss Piggy", "Kermit", "Animal");
```

The first two argument values are stored in `a` and `b`, respectively, and the
remaining values are stored in the `muppets` array. If we call `muppetLab()` and
only pass two arguments, the value of `muppets` will be an empty array:

```js
muppetLab("Dr. Bunson", "Beaker");
// => Dr. Bunson Beaker
// => []
// => undefined
// => 0
```

Since the `rest` parameter gathers the "rest" of the arguments given to a
function, it should always come at the end of the list of parameters.

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned about three tools we can use with arguments and
parameters: `default`, `spread`, and `rest`. We use `default` any time we have a
value we want to use by default for a parameter but still want to be able to
override that value easily. We can use the `spread` operator to efficiently pass
values in an array as arguments to a function. Finally, we use the `rest`
parameter when we want to capture arguments in an array. This can be
particularly helpful when we aren't sure how many arguments will be passed in
but still want access to all of them inside our function.

Given that the syntax for the `spread` operator and the `rest` parameter is the
same, how do we know which is being used? It's all about context. If the three
dots occur when you are _calling_ the function, then it's the `spread` operator.
If they happen when you're _defining_ the function, it's the `rest` parameter.
